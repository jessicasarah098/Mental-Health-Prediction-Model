# Mental-Health-Prediction-Model
Our model Mental Health Prediction model predicts whether a person needs to seek Mental health treatment or not based on inputs provided by them. The model effectively captured important predictors of treatment needs, with an accuracy of 0.848, precision of [precision value], recall of [recall value], and F1-score of [F1-score value]. 
The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict mental health outcomes based on various factors. Mental health is a complex domain with multiple interrelated factors contributing to individuals' well-being. By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project seeks to identify patterns and risk factors associated with mental health conditions, enabling early identification and intervention.

This project has the potential to contribute to the field of mental health by providing a data-driven approach to early identification and intervention. The developed machine learning models can assist mental health professionals in flagging individuals at risk and guiding appropriate interventions. Moreover, the insights gained from feature importance analysis can contribute to a better understanding of the factors influencing mental health outcomes, informing future research and policy decisions.

This project description serves as a general guideline and can be customized according to specific research objectives, data availability, and desiredÂ outcomes.
