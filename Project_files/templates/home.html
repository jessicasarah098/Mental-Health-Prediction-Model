    <h2>Mental Health Prediction using AdaBoostClassifier</h2>
    <p><i>At our Mental Health Prediction website, we utilize the power of machine learning and specifically the AdaBoostClassifier algorithm to provide predictions related to mental health. We understand the importance of early identification and intervention in mental health conditions, and our prediction questionnaire aims to assist individuals in assessing their mental well-being.</i></p>
    <p>Our prediction questionnaire consists of a series of carefully designed questions that cover various aspects of mental health. These questions are based on established psychological scales and validated measures used in the field of mental health assessment.</p>
    <p>When you complete the questionnaire, your responses are processed and fed into the AdaBoostClassifier algorithm. AdaBoostClassifier is a powerful machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners (decision trees) to create a strong predictive model. It focuses on learning from the patterns in the data and improving its predictions iteratively.</p>
    <p>Once the AdaBoostClassifier model is trained, it becomes capable of predicting mental health outcomes based on the responses provided by individuals in the questionnaire. When you submit your completed questionnaire, our website feeds your responses into the model, which applies its learned patterns to generate a prediction.</p>
    <p>It's important to note that the predictions provided by our website are not definitive diagnoses. They are intended to serve as an indicator of potential mental health concerns. The predictions are based on the patterns and correlations observed in the training data. However, for a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis, we highly recommend consulting with a qualified mental health professional who can further evaluate your situation.</p>
    <p>We take your privacy and data security seriously. Any personal information or responses you provide in the questionnaire are treated with the utmost confidentiality and are securely stored. We adhere to strict privacy policies and comply with applicable data protection regulations to ensure the privacy
